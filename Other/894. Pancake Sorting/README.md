# Pancake Sorting

Given an an unsorted array, sort the given array. You are allowed to do only following operation on array.

`flip(arr, i)`: Reverse array from `0` to `i`.

Unlike a traditional sorting algorithm, which attempts to sort with the fewest comparisons possible, the goal is to sort the sequence in as few reversals as possible.

Example

Given array = `[6, 11, 10, 12, 7, 23, 20]`.

Use `FlipTool.flip(arr, i)` function to sort the array.

Note that:

You only call flip function.

You are not allowed to use any sort function or other sort methods.

You are not allowed to do any change to the array, like: `array[0] = array[1]`;

唔。。。。。真的想知道是谁出的这么睿智的题。
就像华为的 `swap(array, i)`题。
