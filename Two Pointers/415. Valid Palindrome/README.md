# Valid Palindrome

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Example

`"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"` is a palindrome.

`"race a car"` is not a palindrome.

Use Character class to check if it's a character or digit and since it's case insensitive, cast all letters to upper(lower) case.
