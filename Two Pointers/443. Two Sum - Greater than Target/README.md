# Two Sum - Greater than Target

Given an array of integers, find how many pairs in the array such that their sum is larger than a specific target number. Return the number of pairs.

Example
Given numbers = `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, target = `24`. Return `1`. (11 + 15 is the only pair)

Tried to start from the middle of one search and then let the `left` pointer move right or left, but actually this only makes it more complicated.
