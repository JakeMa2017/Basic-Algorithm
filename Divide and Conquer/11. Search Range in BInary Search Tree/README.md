# Search Range in Binary Search Tree
---

Given a binary search tree and a range `[k1, k2]`, return all elements in the given range.

If `k1` = 10 and `k2` = 22, then your function should return `[12, 20, 22]`.
```
    20
   /  \
  8   22
 / \
4   12
```

Since this tree is aleady sorted, we can use some simple and violent method instead of using divide and conquer.
